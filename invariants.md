## Post-Completion Invariants

Once completion is reached:

1. No new objective may be introduced.
2. No behavior may be justified by revenue.
3. No structural change may be motivated by growth.
4. No silence may be replaced by explanation.
5. No artifact may demand interpretation.
6. No success authorizes acceleration.
7. No pressure authorizes response.

Completion is a terminal state, not a launchpad.
