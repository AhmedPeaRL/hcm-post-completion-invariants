# HCM – Post Completion Invariants

This repository defines the non-negotiable invariants that apply after the HCM system reaches structural completion.

These invariants exist to protect coherence after success.
They are not goals.
They are not values.
They are constraints.

Any system that violates these invariants is no longer HCM-aligned.
